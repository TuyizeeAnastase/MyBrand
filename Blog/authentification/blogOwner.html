             Core i7 is a family of high-end performance 64-bit x86-64 processors designed by Intel for high-end desktops and laptops.
             Core i7 was introduced in 2008 following the retirement of the Core 2 Quad family.
             Core i7 microprocessors are the high-end brand from the Core family, positioned above both the Core i5 and the Core i3.</br>
            
             7th generation Core i7 processors, models which were introduced by Intel in early 2017,
             are manufactured on Intel's improved 14 nm process "14nm+" which allowed for higher clock speeds at similar voltage levels.
             As such most models enjoy a modest 100 to 300 MHz clock increase over their previous generation for the same price 
             (Note that clock-for-clock there is no performance improvement over 6th generation Core i7). Overall very few minor features were 
             introduced in the 7th Generation Core i7 models, including improved GPU support for 4K playback via native hardware acceleration.
              All models incorporate a 600-series integrated graphics processor which is largely identical to their 6th generation 500-series counterparts.
